## 📊 Risk Classification

We utilize a three-tier risk threshold system to guide decision-making:

| Level | Range | Color | Action Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Low** | $<20\%$ | Green | Routine Monitoring |
| **Moderate** | $20-35\%$ | Yellow | Elevated Awareness |
| **Critical** | $>35\%$ | Red | Immediate Intervention / Reroute |
